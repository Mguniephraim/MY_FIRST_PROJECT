                                        Turning is the most common lathe machining operation. During the turning process, a cutting tool removes material from the outer diameter of a rotating workpiece. The main objective of turning is to reduce the workpiece diameter to the desired dimension.
                                        There are two types of turning operations, rough and finish.

                                        Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality and high accuracy of shape and dimension. It has some roughing applications in which grinding removes high volumes of metal very rapidly.

                                        A CNC router provides a great way to do precise engraving of letters and artwork. Getting everything to look great involves properly handling the artwork, and correctly setting up the engraving tool path.

                                        Rotary dies and tools are critical to the labeling industry because they cut desired shapes for labels. Rotary dies come in two basic forms: solid and flexible. Solid dies make up the majority of those in use, but flexible dies are growing in popularity.

                                        Printing cylinders for printing plates are mainly used in machines for flexographic, offset and letterpress printing. According to the machine's requirements they are made of special aluminium or steel alloys. Spilker produces printing cylinders for all
                                        types of machines.
